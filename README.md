# Robotic-and-Computer-vision-training
Training setup for Robotics, Computer Vision and Embedded system

In this project, a robotics laboratory was created for an Indian institution to teach undergraduate students about robotics, computer vision, embedded systems, and coding. The laboratory included a 3-degree-of-freedom robot that moved along rail to pick up and sort objects using computer vision. The team programmed the robot and developed the computer vision system.

Components:-<br/>
Multiple stepper motor<br/>
3 DOF arm<br/>
Atmega 328 micro controller<br/>
Raspberry pi 3+<br/>
USB RGB camera<br/>
Power supply unit<br/>
Custom controller PCB shield<br/>
Stepper drivers<br/>
Stage indication LED<br/>

Software:-<br/>
Computer vision program to detect and locate objects placed in a blue bin run on Raspberry Pi
Atmega 328 controller program for communicating with 3 DOF robotic arm and for controlling the whole system including communication with Raspberry pi to get the objects location and color which would then be used to pick and sort the objects, Along side this the controller code would also operate all the stepper driven conveyour and sorting arm.

My contribution:-<br/>
This was a demanding project which took more than 100 days to design and build. My responsibilities were developing the Electronic system and controller programming. I significantly contributed in localisation of the objects through computer vision.
